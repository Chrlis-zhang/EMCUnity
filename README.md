EMCUnity
=======================

EMCUnity provides a Python interface to the EMC Unity RESTful API

## Description

This module has been developed to provide a pythonic interface for interacting with EMC's Unity line of mid-range storage arrays.  This module supports both Physical arrays (such as the 300/400/500/600 hybrid and all flash models) along with the UnityVSA.  

Although this module provides a layer of abstraction between the REST API and the developer, it is recommended that you review the following documents as a reference, particularly when referencing object names, fields that are available, and the use of filters when querying the array.
